# TO DO

## 1. Determine mean+std deviation over several (~10) estimates of the free energy difference via work-optimized, error-optimimzed, and linear protocols.
## 2. Figure out how to use the gradient with the vmapped simulations
## 3. Figure out memory issues 
## 4. Try 1000-5000 optimization steps  
## 5. Is there hope for the iterative procedure?

# Paper structure/ideas:

## A. JAX-MD can reproduce results that came before
## B. Present 'new' way of quantifying landscape errors (sampling at multiple points) and show that it is better
## C. Iterative thing working

# Timeline:

## Formal check-in once per week
## 1 month: decide which of A-C is ready to write up
