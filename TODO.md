#TO DO

##1. Determine whether work-optimized protocol does as well as the error-optimized protocol at estimating free energy difference at a single point (i.e. Oliver's presentation)
##2. Why isn't gradient descent finding the lowest-error optimal protocols (try 1000-5000 optimization steps) 
##3. Is there hope for the iterative procedure?

#Paper structure/ideas:

## A. JAX-MD can reproduce results that came before
## B. Present 'new' way of quantifying landscape errors (sampling at multiple points) and show that it is better
## C. Iterative thing working

#Timeline:

##Formal check-in once per week
##1 month: decide which of A-C is ready to write up
